Aim:To implement a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS) for which the inputs, outputs and rules are given.

For given inputs, outputs, and rules, create FIS.
Inputs: Temperature and Cloud Cover 
        Temperature: {Freeze, Cool, Warm and Hot} 
        Cloud Cover: {Sunny, Partly Cloud and Overcast} 
 
Output: Speed 
        Speed: {Fast and Slow} 
 
Rules: 
1. If cloud cover is Sunny and temperature is warm, then drive Fast Sunny (Cover) and Warm (Temp) -> Fast (Speed) 
2. If cloud cover is cloudy and temperature is cool, then drive Slow Cloudy (Cover) and Cool (Temp) -> Slow (Speed)


Algorithm:
1. Go to command window in Matlab and type fuzzy. 
2. Now, new Fuzzy Logic Designer window will be opened. 
3. Input / Output Variable 
    o Go to Edit Window and click Add variable. 
    o As per our requirements create two input variables, Temperature and Cloud Cover. 
    o Create one output variable, Speed. 
4. Goto Rules: Edit Rules 
5. Add the Rules: 
   Rule-1: Sunny (Cover) and Warm (Temp) -> Fast (Speed) 
   Rule-2: Cloudy (Cover) and Cool (Temp) -> Slow (Speed) 
6. Go to view Rules 
7. Exit.
