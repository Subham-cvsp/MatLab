Aim:To find the weight matrix of an auto associative net to store the vector (1 1 -1 -1). Test the response of the network by presenting the 
same pattern and recognize whether it is a known vector or unknown vector.


A = [1 1 -1 -1];
W = [0 0 0 0;0 0 0 0;0 0 0 0;0 0 0 0];
b = transpose(A);
W = b*A;
disp(W);
