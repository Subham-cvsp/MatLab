Aim:To perform union, intersection, complement operations of fuzzy set.

S = [0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4];
T = [0.2,0.6, 0.4, 0.7];
w = min(S,T);
x = max(S,T);
y = 1-S;
z = 1-T;
disp("Union of Set S and T");
disp(x);
disp("Intersection of Set S and T");
disp(w);
disp("Compliment of first fuzzy set");
disp(y);
disp("Compliment of second fuzzy set");
disp(z);
